# FlashCards

## Abstract

Flashcards is intended to be a terminal-playable, trivia-game.  The user can input answers for questions and recieves feedback based upon their answer.

## GIF of Working Application

I did not get through Iteration 3 to have the game viewable in the terminal.  I will spend the weekend finishing the project for my own benefit.

## Installation/Setup

To install the game, the user should clone the repository to their computer.  However, due to the game being unplayable in it's current state, there is no setup.
